## Making of
### Concept Phase
The map has only had one reference, Cove from COD: Black Ops 2. The reason being I wanted to keep it simple and, whilst Cove is visually pleasing, I decided to make the map stand out with far more interest points.

At that moment I thought about some artificial elements that could be added on top of the natural base (water, sader, rocks, palm trees...). Those elements are the following: containers, ruins, the military base, dead fish for covers...

The main appeal of the level is it's flow. The player can access the middle area and go back from 3 point, although there are another 2 which are only one way around: a ladder to the middle and a palm tree that from the middle. Each side thus has different benefits. 

Another extra element are the 3 sniper spots
