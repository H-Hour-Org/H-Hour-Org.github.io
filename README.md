## Making of
### Concept Phase
The map has only had one reference, Cove from COD: Black Ops 2. The reason being I wanted to keep it simple and, whilst Cove is visually pleasing, I decided to make the map stand out with far more interest points.

At that moment I thought about some artificial elements that could be added on top of the natural base (water, sader, rocks, palm trees...). Those elements are the following: containers, ruins, the military base, dead fish for covers...

The main appeal of the level is it's flow. The player can access the middle area and go back from 3 point, although there are another 2 which are only one way around: a ladder to the middle and a palm tree that from the middle. Each side thus has different benefits. 

Another extra element are the 3 sniper spots, one in the middle which is quite exposed and two of them as a duel on one side of the map

### Blockout Phase
For the blockout I used the free Unity "Blockout" package, which provides the user with many presets, color palettes depending on object type (wall, floor, etc), some rotating and snapping functionalities... 

### Asset gather Phase
The level had a 50+ asset database with multiple options for each one so that the chosen assets would resemble a relistic, belligerant and worn out setting.
The Sketchfab-Unreal combination was a total success since Sketchfab's models have a more organic feel and Unreal has a native .gltf importer.
Here you got a useful asset list:

### Production Phase

### Improvements
On top of the actual level feel, there were two more interesting additions: landscape-mesh blending and vertex painting. However, many meshes such as rocks had a complex and individual material setup that hindered the progress. On top of that, Unreal's materials are set up in a way that with my configuration I could not paint more than 3 in one terrain. In regards to vertex paiting, I was experiencing some other problems and I decided to make it a call it a day and apply these techniques in a future more simple environemt.
